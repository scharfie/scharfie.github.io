# About Me
## My Journey
Programming has been my life ever since I discovered QuickBasic when I was 10.  I was hooked immediately and spent countless hours trying out new ideas.  I've spent the last 20+ years learning, improving, and expanding my skillset.  I'm still in love with the art and craft, and I want to keep the flame burning.

## My Strengths

I'm very comfortable tackling new problems, troubleshooting, and crafting elegant solutions.  I learn fast, work hard, and strive for beautiful, testable code. I have a good sense of finding the 'devil' in the details.  I'm great at isolating and eliminating flaws both in development and the processes surrounding it.  I speak my mind, believe in what I say, and have earned the respect of my peers in the process.  

## My Work

I current work for a smaller organization that handles mostly client work.  As a result, I've  been privileged to work with clients such as CharityBuzz, Ford, Fortune, GE, Gold's Gym, Land O'Frost, and Time Inc.  I currently maintain [UnionPlus](http://www.unionplus.org), [The Why Forum](http://www.thewhyforum.com), [Marmalade Skies](https://www.marmaladeskies.com) and I was the lead developer for the rebuild of [The Fashion Calendar](https://fashioncalendar.com/). On nearly every project I've handled the backend development and most if not all frontend development.

Aside from the web application development, I've handled a large portion of system administrative tasks such as setup and management of servers, databases, and DNS services.  All along the way I've strived to improve the development process, not just for myself but the entire organization.

In short, I'm full-stack (though my primary passion is backend development with frontend development second).

## My Goal

I want to continue expanding my programming knowledge with new challenges, languages, and concepts.  I want to work where my strengths will make a difference, and my weaknesses will become strengths.  

Finally, I want to be humbled by my peers so that I will become a better programmer, and help others do the same.
